FYP Fall 2018:
HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION
Track-O-Matic

The project consists of detecting activities that are done unconsciously when a person is anxious. The aim of this project is to simulate a smartwatch which will identify these activities and send a signal to the individual to stop them from doing it. Our web app will be based on body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs) such as nail biting, foot tapping, smoking etc. 
We used two smarts phones for this purpose. The sensors of the smartphone such as accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. We will be using a neural network to identify these activities. 

We would like to thank our supervisor Ms. Nida Sadaf Khan for the patient guidance, encouragement and advice she has provide. Without her help and constant guidance, we would not have been able to complete our project. Who identified the problems in our project and gave us the solutions to those problems as well and helped us in all our queries very promptly.
